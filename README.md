# Paying with Nuxt 3 public

Finally, after a year of waiting, we can see the new version of the Vue framework - Nuxt version 3.

As soon as it was possible, I immediately started the adventure with it. 
Of course there is still a lot of work to be done to make it a stable version, but it is already worth making friends with it, because it is a new chapter in front-end development and a good investment.
